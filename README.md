# BitTitan Take Home - Eric Peng

## Overview

With this take home problem, I've decided to use the following tech stack to meet the requirements:

- Frontend: React, sass for styling help, React Testing Library for testing

The frontend is in development mode and runs on [Port 3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Things I'm Proud Of

- Firstly, this project was a lot of fun. I enjoyed this given the requirements were very straightforward and easy to understand
- I was able to successfully implement all of the functionality that was provided upfront
- I was able to successfully implement loading screen while waiting for data fetching
- I was able to start the initial unit testing for the development
- I've done my best to comment my code and make them easier to read for the review process
- I was able to devote time to this project and finish

## Things I Would Improve Given More Time

- I would love to have more time. There's always room for improvement and I'd absolutely love to get feedback to learn how I can continuously improve
- I would add more testing
- I would implement dark mode
- I would implement a search bar feature which allow user to filter the product list

## Why I Chose Each Technology

- React is a fantastic tool for its virtual DOM which allows for faster updates, easier DOM manipulation, and less memory wastage. Its component based architecture also allows for more modularity and forming reusable components.
- Sass not only allows me to create variable based on the color code I need to use frequently. I also can use nested syntax to make my styling more organize and easy to follow.

## Finishing Thoughts

Thank you again for the opportunity! I'm really looking forward to hearing back from you. Please do not hesistate to reach out if I can provide any help.
